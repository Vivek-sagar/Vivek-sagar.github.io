# Day 35 - Ordway,CO (1709 miles)

The day started off in Denver! I had gone there yesterday to meet some friends and check out the city. I took a bus from there back to Pueblo, went to my warmshower host's place (she not only let me stay an extra day, but also let me keep my bike at her place while I was in Denver), got ready and set off. 
Today was a 53 mile, flat ride. There wasn't much by way of scenery. It got really hot in the afternoon and there was a constant headwind that was a little annoying.
About three quarters of the way in, I met three other bikers going the same way - Troy, Jens and Karina. They were going at more or less my pace, so I decided to stay with them through the rest of the day.
That was the first time in this trip that I rode with a group, and it reminded me how different the experience is. Troy reminded me to stay close to him so I can draft. Trying to stay on his tail, however, was harder than I expected. I had to keep the pace of the group, not my own. I feel like I'm better off biking on my own.
This was the first day on the TrasAm trail (since the Western Express trail ends in Pueblo), and I can already see so many more bikers on the streets. I was told that this was going to be the case, and I imagine this will continue through the rest of the trip.
Tomorrow, I plan to do a 100 mile day. Not sure how far I can go. It really depends on the winds. Hopefully I can make it all the way without getting burnt out.

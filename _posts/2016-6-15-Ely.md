# Day 11 - Ely, NV ( 567 miles )

One of the reasons I decided to do this ride is to change myself, push my limits. And today, I certainly hit that goal! I knew it was going to be a tough day - 78 miles and 4200 ft climb. So mentally, I was prepared for it. What I wasn't prepared for was the heavy headwinds I had over the last 10 miles. Things went smoothly until I got up to my fourth and final pass for the day. The last 10 miles were all downhill, so I felt pretty good. But as I descended, the wind was so strong, I had to pedal to even keep a 15mph pace! Down the mountain! The situation just kept getting worse as I got closer to Ely. When you expect a nice clean downhill but instead have to fight to keep moving forward with 10 miles to go, it can be incredibly demoralizing. But after a lot of effort and breaks, I finally made it to Ely at 3:30 PM, 2 hours later than I had hoped. I've always heard bike tourers complain about headwinds, but today was the first time I actually felt their pain.
Anyways, I still managed to complete the day. I met a bunch of cyclists on the way. They seemed to be racing. They had a support car and everything. Can't say I didn't envy them : no luggage, a big big group and a support car! I tried to keep pace with them but it was a futile effort.
Tomorrow is a lighter day - less miles, less climbs. Hopefully won't have too much wind!

# Day 28 - Montrose, CO ( 1411 miles )

It's my third day in Montrose today, trying to recover from my tiredness. And I still don't feel perfectly fine.
I have been having diarrhea ever since that ride from Hite to Blanding. That's a week now! Initially I thought that it was just my body reacting to all the stress of going that far in the heat. It seemed to be improving at one point, but over the last few days it's gotten much worse!
Montrose is a fairly big city. The next city of this size that I am going to be in, is Pueblo. So I've been hanging around, trying to make sure I am okay before heading forward. Up next is a few hills and then a monster mountain up to Monarch Pass at 11,000 ft! That's the highest point in this entire journey and the weather is supposedly pretty rough out there. So I don't want to be in a bad shape for the next few days!

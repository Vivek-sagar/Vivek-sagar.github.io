 
# Day 4 - South Lake Tahoe (167 miles)ï»¿

Today was another short (30 mile), steep ride. Looking back, I think it went pretty smoothly, though this wasn't what I was thinking while riding. The initial 4 miles or so were really steep and I was doing some 3 mph. It definitely felt like I had underestimated the ride at that point. I pushed through anyway, and the next 6 miles were better with a few flat sections and moderate slopes. After 10 miles came the highlight of the day - A beautiful view of Lake Tahoe followed by 4 miles of downhill. I was going at 30mph! Then a few more ups and downs until I finally rolled into South Lake Tahoe at around 12:30PM. I had a huge lunch of Thai Curry puffs and Panang curry and checked into a Motel 6. 
The last two days have been tough not just on my legs, but on my body too. My butt hurt pretty bad yesterday when I had the padded pants on and was a little better today, with boxers and shorts. What really troubled me today were my hands. The gloves seemed to be digging into the spaces between my fingers and my hands get really weak after a few hours of riding. It got so bad today that I wasn't able to shift the front gears towards the end of the ride. I even took the bike to a shop to make sure the derailleur was ok, and it was. It's just my hands. Need to take care of them.
South Lake Tahoe is a beautiful little city. I went down to the lake shore (which is like a beach) and bought myself some ice cream and dipped my weary feet in the cool water.
So, a pretty good day all around! Tomorrow I will leave California for the deserts of Nevada.

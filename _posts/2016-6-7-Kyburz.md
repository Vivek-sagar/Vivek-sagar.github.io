 
# Day 2 - Kyburz, CA (168 miles)

Learning from my previous mistakes, I decided to leave early today. I planned to leave by 6:30 AM, but it became 7:00 AM by the time I packed my things and said my goodbyes. Still, not too bad. I knew today was going to be all uphill so I shed some weight - the jacket, duct tape, broken mirror, and cycling cap.
My plan was to reach Pollock Pines around 9:30 AM. That way I could have brunch there and get to Kyburz before the heat set in. Though it was pretty tough, that's exactly how things turned out. The first half was a solid 2000 ft climb over some 15 miles. Then quick Taco Bell brunch. At that point I had 2000 ft up, 1000ft down and 21 miles left. Easy, right? Turns out, no. As soon as I left Pollock Pines, I descended fast. I was hitting 30 mph! That speed helped me get over small hills on the way. This went on for 10 miles. The next few miles were hard work, but I was still keeping a good pace. Finally, just before turning away from Highway 50 to the campground, I checked to see what was left - 1000 ft up in 2 miles! That was pretty crazy! Just looking up at the road scared me. I ended up having to get off my bike and push it the entire 2 miles! It took a while, but I made it by around 1:00 PM. 
The campsite here is a nice little spot. Though there aren't any public showers here, the manager graciously let me take a bath in her own shower. I set up tent, had a cold breakfast burrito, and am ready to head to bed. All in all, pretty good day, especially after the scare yesterday.

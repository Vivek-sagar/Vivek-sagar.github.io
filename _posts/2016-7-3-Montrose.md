# Day 29 - Montrose, CO ( 1411 miles )

So I am still in Montrose. After 4 days! This time, I am writing from a hospital bed! That too in the middle of the night, at 12:00 AM!
In the morning, I wasn't feeling very good. My poop was still loose and I didn't feel like I had improved at all. So I decided to go to the hospital. Except, the urgent care facility in town, other hospitals opens only at noon on Sundays! So I waited it out until then and got there. After another hour and a half of waiting at the hospital, they tell me they can't login to the system to process my insurance! So I either pay up the $169 consultation fee in full, or wait till the receptionist is able to get her password reset and can access the system again! And being the fourth of July weekend, it was pretty clear no one was going to reset a password anytime soon.
I pay close to $1K in insurance every semester and now, when I actually need it, some system error renders it useless? That kicked me off. So I just withdrew my application and got out of there. So I still hadn't learnt anything about my ailment!
Back at the campground (I checked into a KOA for tonight) I met another lady who was biking through Colorado. She seemed to really know what she was doing. We got to talking and I told her about my situation. She suggested it might be a parasite in my stomach.
As I did more research on stomach parasites, it seemed more and more likely that's what I had. The only problem is that the only drug that cures it is a prescription drug. That meant I have to see a doctor!
So at 9:00 PM, my dad found this ER facility at a nearby hospital, and I came over to see the doc.
The doctor checked my stool and everything and suggested that there was nothing to be done since it seemed like I was getting better! She then added that she could do the tests on the sample to rule out bacteria and parasites. I wasn't going to go back empty handed again, so I asked her to do the tests. So here I am, an hour later, waiting for the results from the lab.
It's been a frustrating couple of days. I thought I'd be in Pueblo by now, celebrating my completion of the Western Express, but I am still some 4 days away from that,
â€‹Oh well, shit happens!

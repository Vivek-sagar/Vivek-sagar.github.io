 
# Day 1 - Davis, CA (61 miles)

Got through my first day! It was so good to be back on the bike after a while. I felt great through most of the trip. The only real problem was the heat. I didn't check the temperature, but it felt really hot all through the ride. All exposed parts of my skin now hurt. Need to take better care of that!
The route was quite nice. I tried navigation with Google maps and it worked really well. It suggested a slightly different route than the ACA maps - shorter and through smaller roads with a lot of turns, but the voice navigation guided me beautifully through all of it. I think I'll use this more often now, wherever I have internet.
I must say a few words about warmshowers and my hosts. TL;DR they're both awesome! I am staying with Martin and Ashlin tonight and they are both lovely people. We had a lot of fun talking about previous bike trips and they gave me a ton of great advice on the TransAm route ( part of which they did last year). After a nice shower, they made me a delicious pasta dinner and we spoke about our lives, careers and interests. They also had similar glowing reviews of warmshowers hosts that they stayed with during their trips. Overall, it's a huge help for travelling cyclists to be able to meet likeminded people en route and get a nice shower and bed for the night. 
Tomorrow seems like it'll be much of the same - flatish farmlands and high temperatures. One more day of seasoning before the long hard climb to Lake Tahoe!

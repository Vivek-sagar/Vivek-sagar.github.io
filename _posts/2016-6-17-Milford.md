# Day 13 - Milford, UT ( 713 miles )

Today was my longest day yet - 84 miles with more than  3000 ft climb. Honestly though, it was a lot more brutal than that. I thought wind would be the biggest problem, but it actually helped a bit since I had a light tailwind on the climbs. The heat was what really got me. Since I crossed over to Utah, the timezone changed. Though I thought that I started at 6:30 AM, it was really 7:30 AM! By 11:00 AM, the sun was bright and shining and I was really feeling the heat. There is absolutely no shade in this stretch so I was under the sun pretty much the whole way. I carried 4L of water, thinking that carrying my max capacity of 5L would make my backpack heavy and slow me down. Big mistake! 
The extra liter of water was definitely worth having because 50 miles in, I was running out of water. I had probably half a liter and my emergency 600 ml bottle left, where as I had 30 miles to go. I ended up having to flag a car down and getting a bottle from them! They were really nice about it and gave me the entire bottle!
I met a bunch of other riders while camping in Baker last night and we had a great time chatting during dinner. I met two of them again today. The two others are a grandpa and and grandson! I saw them on my ride here, but didn't see them since. Hopefully they got here okay.
So a few tough days over the past week. I hear that Utah offers much of the same - winds, cloudbursts and heat. But it is supposed to be prettier, let's see!

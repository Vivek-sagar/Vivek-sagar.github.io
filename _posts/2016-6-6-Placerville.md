 
# Day 2 - Placerville, CA (131 miles)

Today was one of those hard days. I wasn't even sure I'll make it all the way! 
Let's start from the beginning. I set out by 8:00 AM. By the time I stopped for lunch, I had done 45 miles. I was feeling great. Most of the trail until then was flat, and 20 miles or so from Sacramento to Folsom was on a really nice, shady bike trail. Little did I know about what was coming next. At the 116 mile mark, a hill came up. Pretty tough, but I made it. I was looking forward to the downhill, but it never came. The rest of the 15 miles were really hard. It was 2:00 PM when I started the climb. The sun was blazing hot and the road had heated up too. Pretty much all of that stretch was on the highway, so no chance of shade either. I was creeping up at a constant 4mph pace. I overheated multiple times and went through a good 5L of water. After many hours of toiling, I finally rolled into my second WarmShowers stay at 6:30 PM. That's 4.5 hours for 25 miles! Oh well. I'm done now. Peter, my host, gave me a nice Mac and cheese and veggie dinner. I was also able to take some pictures along the way. Tomorrow is a lot more climbing - 4255 ft up as opposed to 2785 ft today. But it's only 35 miles, so just a lot of climbing. My plan is to lose some luggage (my heavy jacket and some smaller things) and leave early so I can get to the campground by lunch.

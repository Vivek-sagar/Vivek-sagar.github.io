# Day 18 - Torrey, UT ( 981 miles )

Today, I improved my record of height climbed. I did 6000 ft! It was certainly a lot of climbing, but the views on the way made it somewhat worth it. I first descended right into a canyon. It was amazing to see the red sandstone all around as I gripped down into the canyon. Then of course was the steep, hard climb out of the canyon. It was really steep and the humidity of this place made me sweat a lot! I got out of the canyon and got to Boulder. I thought it was going to be a small town or something, but all I saw were a few motels and grocery stores spread over a mile or so. Turns out that is Boulder! I initially went past them looking for the town, but then had to backtrack and get some lunch. After that was the big climb of the day. It was hot and I was sweating like crazy! I found a stream midway and washed my hands and face. That was really refreshing!
As I climbed, it started to get cloudy and the higher altitude reduced the temperature too. So it wasn't too bad a climb, still very steep though. Then a very slow up and down descent and I got to Torrey.
Highway 12 is considered to be a "scenic route" and has many viewpoints with little notes about each place along the way. It is fascinating to read the history of this place - how native Americans lived here for 11,000 years, how while people found, explored and eventually settled down here, and how roads and other basic infrastructure was constructed.

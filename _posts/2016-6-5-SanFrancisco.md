 
##Day 1 - San Francisco

Just left uncle's place. I don't think what I'm about to do has still fully sunk in. I stayed up pretty late last night, getting everything in order. Still, I was up by 6:00 AM today. In general I feel pretty good. My bike is very back-heavy, and that's a little troubling, but everything seems to be packed up nice and compact, so that's nice.
Today is going to be a lot of commute - 1 hour on the Caltrain and 1 on the ferry. After that it's a 4-5 hour ride to Davis where I'll stay with my first Warmshowers host! Should be fun :)

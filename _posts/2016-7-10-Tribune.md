# Day 36 - Tribune, KS ( 1836 miles )

Alright! I set a new distance record! We did 127 miles today! I say “we” because I rode the whole day with another cyclist - Joe. We were at Gillian's place in Ordway together and decided to leave together this morning. And it worked out great!
Joe has a slightly higher pace than me, so I was always pushing myself out of my comfort zone to keep up. The morning session was really nice - there wasn't much wind and it stayed cool. The terrain was completely flat, so we were able to maintain an average speed of 17 mph. 
We got to Sheridan Lake by around 12:00 Noon. And that was already 90 miles! We assumed the next 30 miles to Tribune would be easy, and so decided to take some rest at the church in town, before we set out again. The church was a nice little place with AC, carpeted floors and a kitchen. There wasn't even a single person in sight though. We got water from the kitchen and slept for a little while in the church.
By 4:00 PM we were back on our saddles, cranking out those last 30 miles. By now however, it had gotten really hot and the wind had picked up too. Those last few miles were not fun! The sun and wind were really draining us. We stayed close together throughout and drafted in each other. That helped quite a bit and we finally got here to Tribune. All the motels were full. So we pitched camp at the park. There's a swimming pool right next to the park. The pool and showers are open to bikers for free! So it's all good.

# Day 14 - Cedar City, UT ( 771 miles )

Wow it's been two weeks since I got on the road. Looking back it's weird how many different experiences I've had as I travelled. There was the first few days of urban landscapes and trails. Then the mighty Sierra mountains. The dusty Carson City area. The deserts of Nevada (Great Basin). The rainy day at Austin. Then just barren earth with range, basin, range, basin... and now the hot, rocky Utah. I've heard that Utah is even more beautiful. Today's ride was harder than expected. I didn't feel 100% when I got on my bike in the morning, and it was pretty much a struggle all day. The winds were pretty high and started quite early, so I was battling it all day. I don't think I went past 12 mph for any extended period of time. Yesterday's ride clearly tired me out more than a night's sleep could fix.
I eventually got to my Warmshowers stay though after a frustratingly long ride through the city. This place is amazing! Joe, my host, gave me an entire bedroom and access to the kitchen, fridge, everything! He suggested I take a day of rest since there's a huge 10,000 ft mountain coming up. I think that's what I'll do. Plus, that will let me get my bike checked up tomorrow and maybe finally send those extra things back to my uncle's place. I am also looking forward to sleeping in a little. Haven't woken up after 6:00 AM in two weeks now!

 
# Day 5 - Carson City, NV (238 miles)

Today was a relatively relaxed day. Just 39 miles, most of which was downhill. I could've pushed to Fallon today, but I already had a Warmshowers host here and I wasn't feeling a hundred percent in the morning. I got here by 10:30 AM. The ride was quite nice - one solid uphill, after which was a beautiful windy downhill road that led straight to Carson city. 
Once I got here, I had a nice brunch and headed to my host's place. I took a nap and went off in search for some warm clothes for the upcoming week in the desert. My dad had sent me an article about Bike Smith, a bike shop that tuned touring bikes for free, so I thought I should check it out. They really are as good as the great reviews suggest. They were booked for a week, but still took the time to take a look at my bike when I told them I was touring. They oiled my derailleurs and made sure everything was shifting smoothly and didn't charge a penny for all the work. It felt so nice to receive these little tokens of appreciations from people along the way. My Warmshower host is another interesting person. His house is packed with scrap items that he picks up from various places in order to resell or tear apart. He has probably 20 bikes in the garage and a ton of other crazy stuff. He also had a lot of other interesting stories to tell and took me to a friend's place to pick up some bike parts. 
So pretty interesting, light day and a good start to my desert adventures.

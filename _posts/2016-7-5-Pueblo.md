# Day 31 - Pueblo, CO ( 1653 miles )

Today was a long day. I did around 93 miles! I actually wasn't feeling great in the morning. I stayed at a hostel in Salida. Pretty nice and a really friendly host, but there were 8 people in the room! And someone woke up really early and turned the lights on so I didn't get the best sleep.
Anyways, I started off thinking I'll stop at Canon City and find my way to Pueblo tomorrow. It was a 55 miles ride to Canon City. Google showed a largely downhill elevation profile. But it felt a lot harder than it looked. Probably because of the heat. It's starting to get hot again now that I am back to lower ground level.
I made it to Canon City, got some lunch, and was looking at where I could stay for cheap in the city. Then I saw that someone had messaged from Warmshowers.
I had requested a few hosts at Pueblo in the morning just to see if anything would come off it... and it did!
So I decided to push all the way to Pueblo, That was another 38 miles! I went anyway, and it was a really up-and-down ride. The heat also added up to make it pretty uncomfortable. Once I reached the city, things got a lot more pleasant though. Pueblo is a really nice, green city and I also had a nice 2 mile trail section on my way.
I got here to my Warmshower host Anjali's place and we had a nice daal rice dinner!

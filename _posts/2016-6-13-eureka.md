# Day 9 - Eureka, NV (486 miles)

On paper, today was a long and hard day. The actual experience was a little better than I had imagined it would be. There were two fairly hard climbs at the very beginning that I overcame pretty comfortably. Then a gradual downhill until the next pass about midway through the ride. And then a long 40 miles stretch which was slightly downhill throughout. Surprisingly, that ended up being one of the harder bits. Probably because it was very monotonous for my hands and butt, and my legs were already tired from the climbs. Anyways, it passed and I got to Eureka. 
The weather was fantastic throughout - a light cool breeze with a little bit of sunlight. I even had a tail wind for a while in the long, flat stretch. I was feeling pretty good when I got to Eureka and got some pizza for lunch. I decided to set up my tent for the night and push to Ely tomorrow (I had originally planned a rest day here but now I think I'll do it at Ely). Most towns en route the Western Express and TransAm route know that cyclists stop by so they let us camp in the parks for free. I set up my tent in a nice little park here. I met a Dutch couple going the other way. This is their second US cross country trip apart from their many tours in Europe. Pretty hardcore! The only issue with camping is the lack of facilities for shower, camping and internet. I found a random open WiFi signal that I used to check out tomorrow's ride and pushed shower and laundry to tomorrow. Now for a good night's sleep and then one of the longest biking days of my life - 78 miles and 4000 ft!

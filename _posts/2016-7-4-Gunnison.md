# Day 30 - Gunnison, CO ( 1486 miles )

I finally made it out of Montrose and in some style too! Initially, I planned to only go to Cimarron or at the most to Sapinero. But as I rode, I felt really good. So I kept pushing until I finally made it all the way to Gunnison. Of course, there were a number of other factors that made this possible - it was a perfect day to ride! A little sunny but not hot. Also, I had a nice strong tailwind through most of the day, especially towards the end. Thirdly, I met another cyclist on the way. He looked pretty beaten up and was walking his bike up the hill when I met him. But he told me he was going all the way to Gunnison and had even booked his stay there! So that pushed me to go the whole way too!

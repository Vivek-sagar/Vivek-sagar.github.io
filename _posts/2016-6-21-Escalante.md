# Day 17 - Escalante, UT ( 914 miles )

Today was quite weird. It had a bit of everything. I started a little late - around 7:00 AM. The first few miles were standard road with shoulder. Then came a beautiful little trail called Red Canyon Trail that spanned 10 miles and took me all the way to the top of the first climb for the day. It was perfectly paved, had trees all around and presented great views of the  hills and mountains. The weather was good too. A few clouds took the sting off the sunlight.
I was feeling really good at the top, so I decided to take a small detour. I went 6 miles south to Bryce Canyon. It was amazing to see one entire side of a cliff with those red rock formations. There were a lot of people biking and riding horses and stuff, but no time for that! I got back on track about 2 hours later, headed to Tropic and got some lunch. It was really hot when I was ready to leave again. But about an hour in, it got really cloudy and started to drizzle! That came with heavy winds.
The sudden change in weather and winds threw me off balance a bit, and a huge truck passing through made things worse. I got thrown off the road and fell flat! Luckily, I wasn't hurt - just a few bruises on the thigh. What was more alarming was my front wheel was completely misaligned with the handlebar! I tried not to panic, took out my multi-tool and set the wheel straight. With a stinging thigh, rain, bent bike and everything, it was like a scene from a movie!
Anyways, I fixed the alignment, the bell broke off completely, my handlebar was bent, the handlebar is also damaged but functionally, the bike was good. So all in all, both me and my bike got away with just some minor injuries. Phew! That was lucky!
I limped back on my bike, made sure everything was okay to ride, and did the 30 miles left. I got completely drenched and even dried up on the way and rode up an impossibly steep climb as well!
So like I said, a little bit of everything today! Tomorrow is a long climb. Hopefully, I would have recovered from the shock of the fall!

# Day 26 - Montrose, CO ( 1392 miles )

I haven't been writing for a few days mainly because I have been very tired after the day’s ride. The ride from Hite to Blanding really knocked me out. Ever since then, I have been feeling a little off and haven't been able to move as fast. I took a rest day at Monticello, and that helped quite a bit. I was then able to work my way to Dolores where I got my bike completely checked out.
The shop is called Lizard Head Cyclery and the owner, Nicholas. He really knows his stuff! He went through every detail of my bike and found a number of things in dangerously damaged condition! Here's a list of everything we found:
the rack screws were loose and one was missing.
a spoke was broken on the back wheel.
the stem was incorrectly mounted and might have popped off or broken.
the chain had reached end of life (this is the reason why I stopped by there in the first place!)
the pedal shaft had cracked!
the previous owner had converted a fixed gear into the middle gear in a set of three, so it didn't shift smoothly.
the front brake cable was peeling off and was generally in bad shape.
In two hours, Nicholas found and fixed all of these things and tested the whole thing out too. I was absolutely convinced that something could've gone drastically wrong, if not for his keen eyes and expertise. It's guys like him that make bike touring a pleasure. Keep doing what you do man!
Then was a long climb to Lizard Head Pass. I wasn't feeling very good so I initially thought I'd do the 30 miles or so to Rico and stop there, and do the other 15 miles the next day. When I got to Rico and had a nice Chicken curry and rice brunch. At that point, I felt energetic enough to go all the way to the top. The only problem was that the two cities after this (Telluride and Placerville) were very expensive towns and I wasn’t going to be able to get a room for less than 200$!
The fact that it was nearing 4th of July didn't help. Many campgrounds around there were getting full! So I decided to camp at Matterhorn Campground which was just after the pass.
I met the grandpa and grandson duo on my way! They were doing fantastically well! I told them about the campground too and they also thought it was a good idea.
When I got to the camp, there were no hosts around. It just had a notice board that said to pick any site that was free and pay the host when they come around. So I went in, found a free site and started unpacking my tent. Before I could pitch it, it started raining. So I hurried and pitched tent, put on the rain fly, and put my soaking wet bags inside. The tent floor was going to be a wet mess. Ugh!
Once all this is done, someone comes up to me and tells me that the site was reserved! I ask him if he knows where I am allowed to pitch and he says he's got no idea, he wasn't the park ranger. So there I am, standing in the rain. Now I have to pack my tent(already wet) in the rain and find another place to pitch it again! Frustrating to the core!
Before I packed, I scouted around for a place to pitch. Pretty much every site had been taken and the few that were still empty were reserved! And the park ranger was nowhere to be seen!
I decided to just pack the tent anyway and see what I could do. So I packed up and was about to re-mount everything on my bike when I saw Gary and Christian! They had made it to the camp and had found a spot that was reserved only from the next day! So I joined them and re-pitched my tent. The rain had stopped, but my tent was still quite wet inside and out.
If there's one thing I hate about camping, it's camping in the rain. I've had nightmares of trying to sleep in soggy clothes in a wet tent. And here, I was doing exactly that. But, by now I was even somewhat okay with it! Thankfully the camp had a shower so I was able to clean up and put on some fresh clothes before sleeping.
It rained all night and all the way until 8:00 AM next morning! Surprisingly though, I got pretty good sleep. I had a warm shirt and jacket on and my sleeping bag on top of that, so I didn't feel cold.
As soon as the rain stopped, I got out, got ready, packed up my tent and changed to my cycling clothes. Once I was on my bike, it didn't feel very bad at all! It was just like any other day.
I am finally at Montrose now, which is a big city with all the creature comforts. It's nice to be back in civilization.

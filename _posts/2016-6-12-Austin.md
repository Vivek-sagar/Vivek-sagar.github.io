# Day 8 - Austin,NV (414 miles)

Today was a hard day. On paper, it is one of the easiest stage in the desert stage, but it took some effort to get here to Austin. It rained, off and on, throughout the day. I got wet some half an hour into the ride in the morning. I contemplated staying the day at Cold Springs Station and letting the storm pass, but for better or worse, I decided to push on to Austin. Things went well until my first climb when I got wet again from another spell of rain. Then again about 10 miles away from Austin. Finally, I was 2 miles away laboring through the last steep climb when a thunderstorm came by and completely soaked me. I checked into the first motel I saw as soon as I got into Austin and took a warm shower. After some sleep and food, I feel much better now. Tomorrow I do 70 miles as opposed to the 47 miles I did today. I also have to climb a few hundred feet more.  Thankfully, the weather looks good - clear skies with a max of 20 C. The day after that is even more strenuous in terms of distance and height. Let me take it one day at a time, I guess.
There are a few more items I realized I might not need during the trip and might want to get rid of - extra clothes, bungee cords and toilet rolls. I wanted to send them back from the post office today, but was too tired to make my way there. Maybe I'll do it at Eureka tomorrow. 
Other than that, my legs are tired, my knees hurt a bit but overall, I am doing pretty well. Just need to make sure that I am mentally strong to face and overcome the next few days!
